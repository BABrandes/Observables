# New Test Suites Added

This document summarizes the new test suites added to ensure thread safety, memory management, and performance of the observables library.

## ðŸ§µ Thread Safety Tests (`test_thread_safety.py`)

### **Purpose**
Verify that the library is safe to use in multi-threaded environments and that no race conditions exist in critical operations.

### **Test Coverage**
- **Concurrent value modifications**: Multiple threads modifying observable values simultaneously
- **Hook activation/deactivation race conditions**: Testing the TOCTOU fix for hook state changes
- **Concurrent binding operations**: Multiple threads creating and destroying bindings
- **Listener thread safety**: Concurrent listener addition/removal and notifications
- **Observable-specific threading**: Thread safety for `ObservableList`, `ObservableDict` operations
- **Emitter hook concurrency**: Concurrent access to emitter hooks during modifications
- **Stress testing**: Complex scenarios with many concurrent operations

### **Key Features Tested**
- âœ… Race condition prevention in hook activation/deactivation
- âœ… Thread-safe value setting and getting
- âœ… Safe concurrent binding creation/destruction  
- âœ… Thread-safe listener management
- âœ… Emitter hook thread safety

## ðŸ§  Memory Management Tests (`test_basic_memory.py`)

### **Purpose**
Verify that the library properly manages memory and doesn't have memory leaks, especially in complex binding scenarios.

### **Test Coverage**
- **Basic cleanup**: Simple observables, listeners, emitter hooks
- **Binding cleanup**: Simple and complex binding networks
- **Stress scenarios**: Many short-lived observables, mixed types
- **Detachment cleanup**: Memory cleanup after binding detachment

### **Key Features Tested**
- âœ… No memory leaks in simple cases
- âœ… Proper cleanup of bound observables
- âœ… Emitter hook memory management
- âœ… Listener cleanup
- âœ… Stress test memory stability

## âš¡ Performance Tests (`test_performance.py`)

### **Purpose**
Verify that performance optimizations (especially O(1) cache lookups) are working correctly and detect performance regressions.

### **Test Coverage**
- **Cache performance**: O(1) lookup verification for `_get_key_for` methods
- **Scalability testing**: Performance scaling with increasing complexity
- **Performance regression detection**: Ensure core operations remain fast
- **Memory usage stability**: Memory growth monitoring during operations

### **Key Features Tested**
- âœ… O(1) cache lookup performance (first call O(n), subsequent O(1))
- âœ… Emitter hook cache effectiveness
- âœ… Binding operation scalability
- âœ… Memory usage stability under stress
- âœ… Core operation performance baselines
